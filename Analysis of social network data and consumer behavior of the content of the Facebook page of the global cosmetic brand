# Analysis of social network data and consumer behavior of the content of the Facebook page of the global cosmetic brand "N N N"
# To work with the data, I chose to pre-process and clean the data in Power Query.
# The next tool I used is BigQuery public and SQL queries.
# The data obtained in this sequence was visualized using Tableau public.
# In the final, I received 10 visualizations, which I combined into 3 dashboards with analytics based on which specific conclusions can be drawn. 
# And provide recommendations on the work of the PR department and coordinate the direction of the strategic development of the "N N N" brand for a certain period,
# subject to the analysis of additional profitability metrics and the use of the advertising budget on the "N N N" brand page.
